# 👋 Hey There, I’m Beshah Ashenafi  

I'm Beshah, a **4th-year Information Systems student** from Ethiopia at Addis Ababa University 🎓 (graduating June 2026).  
As a **Front-End Developer**, I’m passionate about crafting **responsive, pixel-perfect web experiences** with **React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS**, and more. Outside of code, I’m a coffee lover ☕ who enjoys translating English ↔ Amharic to connect people across cultures.
